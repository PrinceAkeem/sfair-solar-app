# sfair-solar-app
A django app that generates cash in your pocket.
This repository doesn't include the entire project, there's still a lot more work to be done.
D3.js used for "battery charging" data visualization - though the one in this repository is just a demo, 
I'm learning D3.js and trying to figure out how I can build and algorithmn that could translate the amount of energy
produced and consumed by the solar panels.

It all started when I was in college; I thought of the four main areas Africa needs to improve on in order to 
catch up to the developed world and the digital revolution in particular. And those being: Education, sustainable 
energy (particularly solar - I mean we have a giant fusion reactor over our heads 365 days a year that could power
the entire continent), healthcare, and agriculture(emphasis on irrigation)/clean water.

And I think with solar power, the other three will naturally fall in-line. Hence, the idea of building a solar 
service company is very important to me.

I used to think that it's the job of the government to provide these things, but recently I'm of the opinion that 
in order for us to have a better future, we need really smart individuals working day and night, like hell, trying 
to solve the biggest challenges in Africa. And with that, the basis of an entrepreneurial spirit needs to be revamped 
into the minds of the people, and you do that by evenly distributing social capital and urging the sharing of knowledge - the knowledge 
of code, AI, engineering, genetics and so on. And electricity is a vehicle for all the aforementioned.
